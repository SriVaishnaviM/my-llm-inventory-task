## GenAI-Powered Inventory Management System

### Project Overview

This project implements a two-tiered system for inventory management, featuring a core Inventory Web Service and a Model Control Plane (MCP) Server. The MCP Server leverages Generative AI (specifically Google Gemini) to interpret natural language queries for inventory operations, translating them into structured API calls for the Inventory Web Service.

This solution demonstrates API design, microservice interaction, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for intuitive user interfaces.
